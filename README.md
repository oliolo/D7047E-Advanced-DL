Exercise 2

1.1.1

Newly trained model: 67% accuracy

Fine tuning:

Feature Extraction: 83% accuracy

Difference between Fine tuning & Feature extraction:

Fine tuning: In the fine-tuning strategy all weights are changed when training on the new task except for the weights of the last layers for the original task.

Feature Extraction: In the feature extraction strategy only the weights of the newly added last layers change during the training phase.

1.1.2

Train a CNN on the mnist dataset: 95% accuracy

Use pre-trained CNN on SVHN dataset: 77% accuracy
